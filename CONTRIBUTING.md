# Contributing to evstore

A formal contribution guideline document is in the works. In the meantime,

- stick to the exisiting coding and formatting styles,
- maintain the current file and folder structure (it is quite simple and self-explanatory right now. Drop me a line if something isn't clear),
- write test cases for every new piece of functionality and ensure good code coverage. Automated builds and coverage reports will be set up soon.
