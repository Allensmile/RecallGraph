# Contributing to evstore

Thanks for taking the time to help improve _evstore_!

A formal contribution guideline wiki is [in the works](https://github.com/adityamukho/evstore/wiki/Contributing). In the meantime, please adhere to the following guiding principles:

- stick to the exisiting [coding and formatting styles](https://standardjs.com/),
- maintain the current file and folder structure (it is quite simple and self-explanatory right now. [Drop me a line](https://gitter.im/evstore/community) if something isn't clear),
- write test cases for every new piece of functionality and ensure good code coverage. Automated builds and coverage reports are run on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/adityamukho/evstore/) for each PR.
